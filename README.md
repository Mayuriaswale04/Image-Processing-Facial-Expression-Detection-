# Image-Processing-Facial-Expression-Detection-
This project detects and classifies facial expressions from static images using computer vision techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It can recognize emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, and more.

Key Features: Face detection using Haar Cascade Classifier (OpenCV) Feature extraction using Dlib facial landmarks Emotion classification using a CNN model (Keras/TensorFlow) Works on input images and returns emotion label(s) Trained on popular datasets like FER-2013 (or your dataset)

Technologies Used: Python OpenCV Dlib TensorFlow / Keras NumPy / Matplotlib

How to Run:

Clone the repository
Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
Run the detection script on any image
View predicted emotion output
